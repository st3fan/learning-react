## Learning React
*Stefan Arentz, January 2017*

I thought it would be a good idea to have a better understanding of modern web development techniques and frameworks this year.

As a start I picked up a copy of [Learning React](https://www.kirupa.com/book/index.htm) by *Kirupa Chinnathambi* and started working my way through it. This repository contains the code from that book. Often changed to make them more slightly interesting experiments and explore a little further. Don't expect just a copy of what is in the book.

There is also a *Go* server side component that I wrote. The book mostly focusses on React's core functionality, which does not (AFAIK - I am not through the book yet) contain a module for persistence or talking to REST APIs. So I am also doing some experiments there. The tiny API server contains the supporting code for that. I'll document that a bit better when things get more interesting then `/api/random-colors`.
